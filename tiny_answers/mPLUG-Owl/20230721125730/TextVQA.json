        "question": "what made me a fugitive?",
        "answer": "The image shows a newspaper article about a Chinese man named Liu Yi, who was sentenced for murder. The caption reads, \"Cruelty and insanity made me a fugitive.\" This suggests that the man's actions were extreme and out of control, leading to the crime and his subsequent flight from justice. The fact that the article refers to his actions as both cruel and insane implies that the man's behavior may have been beyond the norms of acceptable human behavior and caused harm to others as a result. The article likely highlights his actions, their consequences, and the efforts made by the authorities to apprehend him.",
