Choose the most likely ratio.\nOptions: 4:0\n3:1\n1:3\n0:4\n2:2\nContext: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:\nWatermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.\nIn a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.\n",
        "answer": "Based on the context, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot would be 4 to 1. This ratio can be calculated using the Punnett square, where the allele for a white ground spot is represented by the square with the letter \"g\" and allele for a yellow ground spot as the square with the letter \"G.\" The square representing the offspring with a yellow ground spot is filled with both \"G\" and \"g\" alleles, while the square representing the offspring with a white ground spot has \"g\" alleles only. The ratio of squares filled with \"G\" alleles to squares filled with \"g\" and \"G\" alleles is 4 to 1, which indicates that in a group of offspring with a yellow ground spot and a white ground spot, there are four times as many offspring with a yellow ground spot as there are offspring with a white ground spot.",

        "question": "Question: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions: operant conditioning\nclassical conditioning\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\n",
        "answer": "Operant conditioning is the process by which an animal learns to associate an external event that is either a reward or a punishment with its voluntary behavior. In this image of a woman teaching a dog to sit by offering a treat, operant conditioning is being used to encourage the dog to perform the desired behavior.",

        "question": "Question: Which of the following could Duncan's test show?\nOptions: whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nif the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nhow steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nContext: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDuncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\n",
        "answer": "Duncan's test showed how a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing when traveling at 200 km per hour. Based on the results of the test, Duncan could determine that a vent of that size would not cause the parachute to swing too wildly. This information would help him decide whether to use that size of vent in the final design of the parachute.",
