        "question": "What causes auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night?",
        "answer": "Auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night are caused by the camera's exposure settings and the lighting conditions in the scene. When a camera takes a photo in low-light conditions, such as at night, it adjusts its settings to capture more light. This can result in a longer exposure time, which allows more light to enter the camera's sensor. However, this also means that the camera captures more light than is necessary, leading to overexposure and the appearance of auras around the traffic lights. The overexposure can cause the traffic lights to appear brighter than they",

In summer, people typically wear lighter clothing and do not need to wear coats. The presence of a coat indicates that the weather is colder, which is more typical for winter or autumn seasons. Additionally, the woman is holding a bag, which could be a handbag or a shopping bag, further supporting the idea that she is outdoors during a colder season.",
