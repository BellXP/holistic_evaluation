The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.\n",
        "answer": "In the food web shown in the image, the matter that ultimately moves to a mushrooms is brown leming. The leming feeds on lichens and mosses, and the matter from those plants moves up the food chain as the leming consumes them. Ultimately, the nutrients from these plants are converted into tissue and excrement, which are consumed by various other organisms, including mollusks and insects, and eventually end up as part of the food source for a mossy, lichen-eating mushroon.",

        "answer": "In the image, it can be seen that England and the Dutch both controlled significant areas of territory in early North America during the colonial era. England mainly held onto the northeastern coastline, while the Dutch controlled large portions of the mid-Atlantic region, including modern-day New York and New Jersey.

Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.\nIn a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.\n",

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nKira prepared ten buckets, each with one gallon of boiling water and three tablespoons of black fabric dye. Kira soaked white linen fabric squares in five of the buckets, and white cotton fabric squares in the other five buckets. All of the fabric squares were soaked for 15 minutes.

        "question": "Question: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions: operant conditioning\nclassical conditioning\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\n",
        "answer": "In the image, the small dog is sitting on a person's lap, and the person is holding a frisbee. It is likely that the dog has been trained to perform this behavior, as it has associated the act of sitting with the person with receiving treats or positive reinforcement.

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nMike mixed bacteria into a nutrient-rich liquid where the bacteria could grow. He poured four ounces of the mixture into each of ten glass flasks. In five of the ten flasks, he also added one teaspoon of cinnamon. He allowed the bacteria in the flasks to grow overnight in a 37\u00b0C room. Then, Mike used a microscope to count the number of bacteria in a small sample from each flask. He compared the amount of bacteria in the liquid with cinnamon to the amount of bacteria in the liquid without cinnamon.\nFigure: flasks of liquid for growing bacteria.\n",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDuncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\n",
