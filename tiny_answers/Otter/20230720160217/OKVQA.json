        "question": "What causes auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night?",
        "answer": "\"Aurora or aureoles, as they are also known, are light phenomenons that surround traffic lights or other light sources at night. They are caused by the reflection and refraction of light in the atmosphere, particularly in the presence of particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, or even ice crystals in colder conditions. These particles act as a lens, focusing and dispersing the light in various directions, creating the aureole or \"\"halo\"\" effect around the light source. This phenomenon is more common during the winter months when the air is colder and the particles are more likely to condense and gather in the upper atmosphere. In the case of the traffic lights, the light from the street lamps or other illuminated sources reflects off these particles, creating a halo around the lights, giving them an ethereal appearance.\".",

The presence of a handbag and a jacket on the bench suggests that the weather might not be warm. The jacket indicates that the temperature is likely lower than warm, and the presence of the handbag might imply that the person is dressed for colder weather. Therefore, we might suspect that the scene is not taking place during the summer, as it is more likely for people to be wearing lighter clothing and enjoying warmer temperatures during that season.",

Males might engage with other males and females, while females might interact with both males and other females, depending on their social group's dynamics.

However, the nice furnishings and decor in the living area could also contribute to a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere, which is typically found in homes as well. It is possible that this particular suite is situated within a hotel, but the overall appearance and arrangement of the furniture and decorations give the impression of a well-maintained and inviting space, which could be found in both homes and hotels.",
