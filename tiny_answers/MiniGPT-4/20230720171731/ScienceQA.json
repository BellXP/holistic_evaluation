Choose the most likely ratio.\nOptions: 4:0\n3:1\n1:3\n0:4\n2:2\nContext: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:\nWatermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.\nIn a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.\n",
        "answer": "The expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 1:3. This is determined by the fact that the allele for the yellow ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for the white ground spot (G), and the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. Therefore, one of the offspring will inherit the allele for the yellow ground spot from both parents, resulting in a yellow ground spot, while the other three offspring will inherit one allele for the yellow ground spot and one allele for the white ground spot, resulting in a white ground spot.",

Kira soaked white linen fabric squares in five of the buckets, and white cotton fabric squares in the other five buckets. All of the fabric squares were soaked for 15 minutes.

        "question": "Question: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions: operant conditioning\nclassical conditioning\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\n",
        "answer": "The term that matches the picture is \"operant conditioning.\" This is because the woman in the picture is sitting on the floor, holding a treat in her hand and looking directly at the camera with a focused and intent look, which suggests that she is participating in an operant conditioning exercise with her dog. Operant conditioning is a type of learning process in which an animal learns to associate certain behaviors with rewards or punishments. In this case, the woman is offering the treat as a reward for the dog's good behavior, which helps to reinforce the behavior and make it more likely to occur in the future.",

He poured four ounces of the mixture into each of ten glass flasks. In five of the ten flasks, he also added one teaspoon of cinnamon. He allowed the bacteria in the flasks to grow overnight in a 37\u00b0C room. Then, Mike used a microscope to count the number of bacteria in a small sample from each flask.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDuncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\n",

Duncan put the parachute in a wind tunnel and observed how it swung at 200 km per hour. From this, he could determine how steady the parachute would be during the descent.",
