The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.\n",
        "answer": "In this food web, the brown lemming is the primary producer, meaning it creates its own food through photosynthesis. The brown lemming eats lichen, which is a type of plant that grows on rocks and trees in the tundra ecosystem. The bilberry is a secondary consumer, meaning it feeds on the brown lemming. The arctic fox is a tertiary consumer, meaning it feeds on the bilberry. The arctic wolf is a quaternary consumer, meaning it feeds on the arctic fox.",

Choose the most likely ratio.\nOptions: 4:0\n3:1\n1:3\n0:4\n2:2\nContext: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:\nWatermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.\nIn a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants.\n",
        "answer": "In the Punnett square, we can see that one parent has a white ground spot (gg) and the other parent has a yellow ground spot (Gg). Since the allele for a white ground spot is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot, all of the offspring from this cross will have yellow ground spots (GG). The expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 2:1, or 67% of the offspring will have yellow ground spots and 33% will have white ground spots.",

        "question": "Question: Which term matches the picture?\nOptions: operant conditioning\nclassical conditioning\nContext: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.\n",
        "answer": "In summary, both classical conditioning and operant conditioning involve associating a response with a stimulus. However, while classical conditioning focuses on unconditioned responses, operant conditioning focuses on voluntary behaviors that can be reinforced or discouraged through external rewards or punishments.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDuncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\n",
