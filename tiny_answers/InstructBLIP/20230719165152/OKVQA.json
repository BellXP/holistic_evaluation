        "question": "What causes auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night?",
        "answer": "Auras around traffic lights when photos are taken at night can be caused by a variety of factors, including camera settings, lighting conditions, and atmospheric conditions. In the image, the bright spots around the traffic lights are likely due to the long exposure time used to capture the scene at night. The camera's shutter is open for a longer period of time, allowing more light to enter the lens and contribute to the overall brightness of the image. Additionally, the use of high-intensity headlights from vehicles passing through the intersection can also contribute to the bright spots around the traffic",

        "answer": "There are several reasons why we might suspect that this is not a summer time scene. Firstly, the woman is wearing a jacket, which suggests that it might be a colder season, such as winter or autumn. Secondly, the black and white photography style used in the image further supports this notion, as it is more commonly associated with indoor or low-light conditions. Lastly, the presence of other people in the scene, including a man holding a bag, also suggests that this is not a summertime scene, as people tend to spend more time outdoors during the warmer months",
