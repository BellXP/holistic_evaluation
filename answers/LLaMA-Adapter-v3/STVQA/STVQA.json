The cooking time will vary depending on the type of chicken, the cut, and the desired doneness. For example, if you are cooking chicken breasts, you may need to cover and let it simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, while if you are cooking chicken thighs, you may need to cover and let it simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. It is essential to use a cooking thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the chicken reaches the desired level of doneness, which is typically 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) for chicken breasts and 175\u00b0F (80\u00b0C) for chicken thighs.",
